# Speed Watch

This program determines whether a car's speed is within the legal limit and calculates demerit points if the speed exceeds the limit.

## Usage

The program checks the speed and prints:
- "Ok" if the speed is less than the speed limit.
- "Points: X" where X is the number of demerit points if the speed exceeds the limit.
- "License suspended" if the demerit points exceed 12.
